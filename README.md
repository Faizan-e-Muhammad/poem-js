# Poem.js

This project was originaly a script written by [@hamzamez][1] to render Arabic poems correctly in the dom.

## What does this project do?

Provide a lightweight JS library to handle Arabic poems and render them in their Vertical style.

## Why is this project useful?

Believe me! Writing Arabic poems inside your web pages, mobile apps is indeed a frustrating job. Then you have to style it properly to give your readers or users a full experience as they used to with books. This process is very annoying espicially for webmasters who have little experience with HTML or CSS.
